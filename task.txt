Here is the the test task. We recommend you first to look at a Django Rest Framework tutorial and also read a bit about the Rest API principles.

Please implement following logic using Django Rest Framework http://www.django-rest-framework.org/ 

Imagine a simplified pizza ordering services with following functionality:

1. Create order. 

    Order data:
    - pizza id
    - pizza size (30cm/50cm)
    - customer name
    - customer address (just plain text)

2. Update order
3. Remove order
4. See a list of customer orders

Tasks:

1. Design Model/DB structure (PostgreSQL)
2. Design and implement API for the described web service. Please note:
- You don’t have to take care about authentication etc, we are just interested in structure and data modelling.
- You don’t have to implement any UI, just the API endpoints
3. Write test(s) for at least one of these endpoint(s)

You have one week to solve the task. In case you have any impediments, let us know. 
After you are done, push it to a public git repository and send me the link.

Have fun and do not hesitate to ask in case you have any questions.
